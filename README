THis is my first time using git,20141025,why now??
-----------------------------------------

I am frustrated by forgetting the tutorials I learned just two weeks ago,SO why not record what I've learned??


What am I going to do in this repo?
-----------------------------------

Record the key points and solved problems during my django trip.Futhermore, I can summerize these contents after I've mastered using django to build my own website.
