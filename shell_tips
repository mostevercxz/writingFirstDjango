1. special shell variables(http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/scrpt/scrpt2.2.2.html)

	$# the number of positional arguments given to this invocation of the shell.
	$? the exit status of the last command executed(given as a decimal string)
	$$ the process number of this shell
	$! the process id of the last command run in the background
	$- the current options supllied to this invocation of the shell
	$* a string containing all the arguments to the shell, starting at $1
	$@ same as above
	"$*" is a single word, comprising all the arguments to the shell, joined together with spaces. '1 2' 3 becomes "1 2 3"
	"$@" is identical to the arguments received by the shell, the resulting list of words completely match what was given to the shell.'1 2' 3 becomes "1 2" "3"

2. shell scripts manipulating(http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html)
	-----------
	string length:
		${#stringVariable}
		expr length $stringVariable
		expr "$stringVariable" : '.*'

	-----------
	substr index
		expr index $string $substr

	-----------
	substr removal
		${string#substring},deletes shortest match of $substring from front of $string
		${string##substring}, deletes longest match

	-----------
	string replacement
		${string/substring/replacement},replace first match of $substring with $replacement
		${string//substring/replacement}, replace all matches
