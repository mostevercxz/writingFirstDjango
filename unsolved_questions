writing your first django app
-----------------------------

1."Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run 'python manage.py migrate' ". Why "we need to create tables"??

2."We'll create our poll app right next to your 'manage.py' file, so that it can be imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mywebsite", how could our poll app be a submodule of mywebsite??

3."This includes the migrations that Django can roll through to update your database schema to match your current models." What does this mean?? How does Django roll through to update my database schema??

6. If I add file "<project-dir>/templates/admin/base_site.html",change the title block to title 'admin template title', and edit file polls/models.py "admin.site.site_header = 'admin site title'" at the same time, then the title would be 'admin template title', but why?? What is the order between these two??

C++ design patterns of get rid of if-else
1. if (book.type == A) do_some();
	else if (book.type ==B ) do_other();
	...
	else do_something()
	
	Make a different class for each type of book, implement the same interface, then invoke BookParent::Parse()
	对每本书,都建立个类，父类虚函数，子类继承。直接调用父类的解析函数即可
	using std::map<>, key is book type, value is a pointer to function
	
2. switch case AND polymorphic
